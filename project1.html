    <h2>How Do Search Engines Work?</h2>
        <p>Search Engines work in a few different ways. The first method, known as a crawler-based engine, 
           is when the engine vigorously searches the entire internet for the key words that a user defines. 
           There are also human-based engines, which are search engines that produce results that have been 
           entered into a database after human interaction. There is also what is known as a hybrid engine. 
           In a hybrid engine, both crawler-based and human-based methods are used. During a hybrid engine 
           search, the engine will search the whole internet for the keywords and then use human input to 
           influence the result rankings.
        </p>
    <h3>The Importance of Keywords and Descriptions as Meta Tags...</h3>
        <p>Description and keyword metatags are important because they help the search engine understand what 
           your page is about. For example, when using the google search engine, sometimes google will display 
           the text written in a pages description meta tag in the search results. The keyword meta tag is 
           important because not everyone will use the same words in a search engine query. By defining keywords, 
           you can tell the search engine to produce results for your page when those keywords are used in the 
           search query.</p>
    <h3>What are the Four Elements that Comprise Writing Relevant Content Links?</h3>
        <p>When it comes to writing relevant content links, it's important that links establish authority. Authority can
           be gained by other websites linking to your website. It also helps search engine optimization when trustworthy sites
           as well as sites that show expertise link to your site. It's also important that links have strong anchor text- anchor
           text is the text that is underlined and blue that a user can click on to link to your site. It's also important to have
           a link that a user is more likely to click and also have the link placed in a good position on the page. 
    <h3>What Constitutes Good Heading Hierarchy?</h3>
            <p>Good heading hierarchy occurs when the more important headings to a webpage consist of a greater size. 
           In HTML, there are headings 1 (h1) through 6 (h6). The most important heading on a webpage should be a 
           h1 because h1 heading's are displayed in a larger and more bold font as opposed to the lower headings. 
           It's important to note that a h1 tag shouldn't be used for the sole purpose of making the font bigger 
           and more bold. the h1 headings should be geared towards the most important information of the page.</p>
           For example, if someone was writing a paper on Maryland's population, They would have the main population
          information for the state under an h1 tag, populations for cities in Maryland as an h3 tag, and populations for towns
          that help makeup cities in an h5 tag. As you increase header number, the header will get "less imporant." For example:
             <h1>Maryland Population</h1>
             <h3 id="h3example">Population by City</h3>
             <h5>Population for Towns</h5>
